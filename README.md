# Mailer BDI-agent Architecture
[![](https://jitpack.io/v/chon-group/Mailer.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#chon-group/Mailer)

Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are groups of autonomous agents that act in the same environment, competing or collaborating to achieve individual or collective goals. 
Some main challenges encountered in communicating different MAS are the connectionless protocols used by some IoT middlewares for agent communication and the lack of security in transferring messages over the internet. 
The Mailer Agent is a customized BDI-based agent architecture that extends the standard [Jason](https://github.com/jason-lang/jason) agent by adding the ability to exchange messages by a connection-oriented communication architecture using secure channels provided by protocols IMAP and SMTP.
Besides, this work contributes to the advancement of MAS by addressing the integration of email protocols to enable secure and simplified human-agent interaction.
